# Tensorflow Deep Learning 🤖📈📉

This is my exploration of [mrdbourke](https://github.com/mrdbourke)'s awesome 🔥 course on Deep Learning using Tensorflow.

## How did I approach learning?

> I wrote and rewrote all of the code myself. Yes, I am serious. Even though there will be much similarity with the original course notebooks, but I rewrote every markdown, every line of code in this entire repository. I took my time to:
>
>
>  ✔️ study everything deeply <br />
>  ✔️ develop my own routines with loads of useful functionalities! <br />
>  ✔️ made this repository into a well structured, and an installable Python package `src` <br />
>  ✔️ tracked issue, tasks, bugs and features like a `pro` 😎 using `Github Issues` and `Github Projects`
